# Terms of Service

Effective Date: January 2026

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern access to and use of the SignalReview
website and services, including the Founding Review product.

By accessing the website or submitting materials for review, you agree to
these Terms.

## 1. Service Description

SignalReview provides a one-time, fixed-scope analytical service known as
“Founding Review”.

Founding Review is an independent economic determination based solely on
materials submitted by the client. The service produces a binary analytical
output indicating whether a detectable scaling signal is present under
current conditions.

The service does not include advisory, consulting, implementation guidance,
optimization, forecasting, or strategic recommendations.

---

## 2. No Advisory Relationship

SignalReview does not provide legal, financial, investment, or business advice.

No advisory, fiduciary, partnership, employment, or agency relationship is
created through the provision of Founding Review or any related materials.

All determinations are analytical in nature and should not be interpreted
as recommendations or endorsements.

---

## 3. Client Responsibilities

You represent and warrant that:

- all submitted information is accurate and complete to the best of your knowledge;
- you have the right to submit the materials provided;
- you understand the limited scope of the service.

SignalReview is not responsible for inaccuracies, omissions, or misleading
information in submitted materials.

---

## 4. Fees and Payment

Founding Review is provided for a one-time fee of USD $400, payable in advance.

Payment confirms your request for the service. Processing begins only after
payment is confirmed and required inputs are complete.

All fees are non-refundable once assessment work has commenced.

## 5. Delivery and Timing

Founding Review is delivered within seventy-two (72) hours after confirmed
payment and receipt of complete, consistent inputs.

Delivery is made electronically via email or secure link.

## 6. Intellectual Property

All methodologies, analytical frameworks, pipeline structures, and internal
logic used by SignalReview constitute proprietary intellectual property and
trade secrets.

Clients receive a limited, non-transferable license to use the delivered
Founding Review for internal evaluation purposes only.

No rights are granted to reproduce, reverse engineer, or derive the underlying
methodology.

## 7. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, SignalReview shall not be liable for
any indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages, including but
not limited to loss of revenue, profits, or business opportunities.

SignalReview’s total liability, if any, shall not exceed the amount paid for
the Founding Review service.

---

## 8. No Guarantee of Outcomes

The presence or absence of a scaling signal does not guarantee success,
failure, funding outcomes, market adoption, or business performance.

All business decisions remain solely the responsibility of the client.

---

## 9. Termination

SignalReview reserves the right to refuse service or terminate access if
submitted materials violate applicable law or these Terms.
