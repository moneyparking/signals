Refund Policy

Payments are accepted for a standalone independent
economic assessment.

Once the review process has commenced,
payments are non-refundable.

If a request is declined prior to commencement
due to scope or capacity constraints,
any received payment is fully refunded.

No refunds are issued after delivery.
