Independent Growth Signal Assessment — Eligibility Outcome


Body:
Hello,

Thank you for submitting your request for an Independent Growth Signal Assessment.

Based on the eligibility screening, we are unable to proceed with an assessment
in this case.

This outcome does not indicate an issue with your business or performance.
It simply reflects that, under the current conditions and inputs provided,
an independent determination would not be reliable or meaningful.

As defined by scope, we do not provide alternative analyses, recommendations,
or follow-up guidance when an assessment is declined.

We appreciate your interest and encourage you to reapply if your scaling context
or data availability changes.

Regards,
Independent Growth Signal Assessment
