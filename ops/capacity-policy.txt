CAPACITY POLICY
Independent Growth Signal Assessment


Assessments are conducted as fixed-scope, one-time engagements
and are subject to capacity constraints.

To preserve independence, methodological consistency, and
delivery quality, the number of concurrent assessments is limited.

Availability is determined based on:
– current assessment load,
– methodological fit,
– data readiness,
– and scheduling constraints.

Submission of an intake request does not guarantee availability.

When capacity is reached, new requests may be deferred or declined.

No waitlists, priority access, or expedited delivery options
are offered.

This policy exists to ensure that each assessment is conducted
with appropriate focus, independence, and rigor.
