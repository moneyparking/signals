CAPACITY POLICY
Independent Growth Signal Assessment operates with limited
capacity to preserve independence and analytical rigor.

During periods of capacity constraints:
– new assessments may be temporarily unavailable;
– confirmed eligibility may be placed on hold or declined;
– no prioritization, fast-tracking, or exceptions apply.

Lack of availability does not reflect a judgment on any
company, request, or situation.

Assessments resume automatically as capacity becomes
available.
