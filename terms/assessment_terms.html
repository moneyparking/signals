<h1>Terms of Service</h1>

<p>
These Terms of Service govern the provision of the
<strong>Independent Growth Signal Assessment</strong>
(the “Assessment”).
</p>

<p>
The Assessment is a fixed-scope, one-time analytical determination
conducted solely for the purpose of evaluating whether the signal
used to justify scaling paid acquisition remains economically
predictive at the current scale.
</p>

<p>
The Assessment does not include consulting, optimization,
implementation guidance, recommendations, or ongoing advisory
services. No alternative signals, strategies, or execution plans
are provided.
</p>

<p>
The sole deliverable of the Assessment is a formal written
determination (PDF) based exclusively on the information provided
by the client during intake.
</p>

<p>
Payments are processed by a third-party Merchant of Record.
Invoices, applicable taxes, and payment processing are handled
by the Merchant of Record in accordance with their terms and
policies.
</p>

<p>
Due to the fixed-scope and analytical nature of the Assessment,
refunds after delivery are not applicable. Any refund requests
prior to delivery are subject to the Merchant of Record’s
standard refund policy.
</p>

<p>
Personal and business information submitted during intake is used
solely for the purpose of conducting the Assessment and is not
sold, shared, or repurposed beyond this scope.
