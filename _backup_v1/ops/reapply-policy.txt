Re-apply Policy

A previously declined request may be resubmitted
only if material changes to the system have occurred.

Material changes include, but are not limited to:
- sustained increase in paid acquisition spend
- formalized and repeatable revenue attribution
- stabilized sales process
- change in primary scaling signal

Re-submission is not considered earlier than
six months from the initial assessment.

Requests that do not meet these conditions
are declined without re-evaluation.
