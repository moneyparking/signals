<h1>Executive Determination — Growth Signal Validity</h1>

<div class="meta">
  Independent Growth Signal Assessment · Executive summary · Illustrative reference
</div>

<h2>Context</h2>

<p>
This determination addresses whether the signal currently used to justify
scaling paid acquisition remains economically predictive at the present
level of spend and revenue.
</p>

<p>
Such determinations are typically required when acquisition metrics remain
stable while revenue outcomes no longer scale proportionally, creating
divergence in internal interpretations and increased capital allocation
risk.
</p>

<h2>Signal Reviewed</h2>

<div class="boxed">
  Scaling decision signal: <strong>Cost Per Lead (CPL)</strong>
</div>

<p>
In this illustrative scenario, CPL stability continued to be used as a
primary trigger for scaling decisions despite emerging lag effects and a
weakening relationship with realized revenue.
</p>

<h2>Assessment Basis</h2>

<p>
The determination considers whether the signal continues to function as a
reliable proxy for downstream revenue outcomes at scale, with specific
attention to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Signal–revenue consistency across time periods</li>
  <li>Material lag between acquisition activity and revenue realization</li>
  <li>Revenue stability relative to incremental spend</li>
</ul>

<h2>Determination</h2>

<div class="determination">
  SIGNAL NO LONGER ECONOMICALLY PREDICTIVE
</div>

<p>
Based on the assessed conditions, the signal used to justify scaling does
not remain economically predictive at the current scale.
</p>

<p>
Continued reliance on this signal materially increases the risk of
inefficient capital allocation and distorted executive decision-making.
</p>

<h2>Scope & Limitations</h2>

<ul>
  <li>One-time, fixed-scope independent determination</li>
  <li>No optimization, remediation, or alternative signals provided</li>
  <li>No implementation or advisory services included</li>
</ul>

<div class="footer-note">
  This executive determination is provided to inform senior decision-making.
  It does not constitute consulting, advisory, financial, or operational
  services and does not replace internal judgment or accountability.
