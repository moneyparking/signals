<h2>1. Scope of Assessment</h2>

<p>
This document illustrates the format, tone, and substance of an
<strong>Independent Growth Signal Assessment</strong> determining whether a
growth signal used for scaling decisions remains economically predictive
of revenue outcomes.
</p>

<p>
This type of determination is typically required when scaling decisions
continue to rely on stable acquisition metrics while revenue outcomes
no longer respond proportionally. At this stage, internal interpretations
often diverge, and an independent determination is required to support
capital allocation and executive decision-making.
</p>

<p>
This is an illustrative sample only. A live assessment is conducted as a
fixed-scope, one-time engagement based exclusively on aggregated
performance signals provided during intake.
</p>

<h2>2. Signal Assessed</h2>

<p><strong>Scaling decision signal under assessment:</strong></p>

<div class="boxed">
  Cost Per Lead (CPL)
</div>

<p>
In this illustrative scenario, scaling decisions continued to rely on
CPL stability despite the presence of material lag effects and a
weakening relationship between lead acquisition costs and realized
revenue.
</p>

<h2>3. Basis for Determination</h2>

<p>
The assessment evaluates whether the signal continues to function as a
reliable proxy for downstream revenue outcomes at the current level of
scale.
</p>

<p>
In particular, the determination considers:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Consistency of the signal–revenue relationship across time windows</li>
  <li>Presence and persistence of material lag effects</li>
  <li>Stability of revenue realization relative to scaling actions</li>
</ul>

<div class="boxed">
  Assessment condition:<br/><br/>
  If the scaling signal remains stable<br/>
  while revenue realization materially lags beyond<br/>
  acceptable system thresholds,<br/>
  the signal is no longer economically predictive.
</div>

<h2>4. Determination</h2>

<div class="determination">
  Determination: SIGNAL NO LONGER PREDICTIVE
</div>

<p>
Based on the assessed conditions, the signal used to justify scaling does
not remain economically predictive at the current level of spend and
revenue.
</p>

<p>
Continued reliance on this signal materially increases the risk of
inefficient capital allocation and distorted scaling decisions.
</p>

<h2>5. Limitations & Exclusions</h2>

<ul>
  <li>This assessment does not include optimization or remediation guidance</li>
  <li>No alternative signals are proposed</li>
  <li>No implementation, operational, or advisory services are provided</li>
  <li>This document is an illustrative example only and not a live assessment</li>
</ul>

<div class="footer-note">
  This document constitutes an illustrative example of an independent
  growth signal determination. It does not constitute consulting,
  advisory, financial, or operational services. The determination is
  intended to inform decision-making, not to replace internal judgment
  or accountability.
